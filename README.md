# DHCRUD-Website
This website is for computer science principles. This website is made by Deion Him and some of it's code is similar to the teacher. This website is for sport fans. To use this website you will need to type in a famous athlete full name in the first textbox then the sport he or she plays and if the athlete a male or female. After the user submit its info it will pop up a sentence saying the athlete name what sport he or she plays and if the athlete and female or male. Example: Lebron James is a professional athlete who plays basketball and is a male. The user will also have an option to update or delete any of its info. Also any changes will pop up in my phpadmin database. I made this website on cloud 9 using html, php, javascript, css, and mysql.
